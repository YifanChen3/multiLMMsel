Description: We propose a moment-based variable selection method for multivariate high-dimensional linear mixed-effects model. By formulating moment equations for cross-products of residuals and inducing sparsity in the covariance matrix of random effects through its diagonal, we reduce the selection problem to a set of smooth convex optimization problems solvable via proximal gradient descent.
